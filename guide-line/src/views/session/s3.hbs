               <p><b>MVC</b><br>JavaScript now has a number of frameworks boasting support for MVC, allowing developers to easily add structure to their applications without great effort.</p>
               <p><b>MVVM</b><br>MVVM (Model View ViewModel) is an architectural pattern based on MVC and MVP, which attempts to more clearly separate the development of user-interfaces (UI) from that of the business logic and behavior in an application.</p>
               
               <div class="page-header"><h1 id="Whatis">MV* Patterns (MVC)</h1></div>
               <p><b>Models</b><br>manage the data for an application. When a model changes, it will typically notify its observers that a change has occurred so that they may react accordingly.</p>
               <p><b>Views</b><br>are a visual representation of models that present a filtered view of their current state. A view typically observes a model and is notified when the model changes, allowing the view to update itself accordingly.</p>
               <p><b>Controllers</b><br>are an intermediary between models and views which are classically responsible for two tasks: they both update the view when the model changes and update the model when the user manipulates the view.</p>
               
               <div class="page-header"><h1 id="Whatis">MV* Patterns (MVVM)</h1></div>
               <p><b>Model</b><br> As with other members of the MV* family, the Model in MVVM represents domain specific data or information that our application will be working with.</p>
               <p><b>View</b><br>MVVM View is considered active rather than passive and contains the data-bindings, events and behaviors which require an understanding of the Model and ViewModel.</p>
               <p><b>ViewModel</b><br>The ViewModel can be considered a specialized Controller that acts as a data converter. It changes Model information into View information, passing commands from the View to the Model.</p>
